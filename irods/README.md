## Using local federated iRODS

The scripts herein are a one-way street that update the configuration of HydroShare to use a locally deployed federated pair 
of iRODS provider v.4.2.0 (PostgreSQL) servers in Docker.

Effected files:
-	modified:   hsctl
-	modified:   hydroshare/local_settings.py
-	modified:   scripts/templates/docker-compose-local-irods.template

### How to use

From within the `irods` directory, run the script named **use-local-irods.sh**

**NOTE:** This script requires that package `jq` be installed on the host from which the script is being run. If it's not present it can be installed by invoking `sudo apt-get install jq` in Ubuntu (or similar) environments. 

```bash
$ cd irods
$ ./use-local-irods.sh
```

  - Optionally the user can choose to persist the iRODS vault and datbase to their local filesystem so that these files would be available even if the containers are destroyed and recreated.

  ```bash
  $ cd irods
  $ ./use-local-irods.sh --persist
  ```
  The `--persist` flag will create two new directories as `/home/${USER}/icat1` and `/home/${USER}/icat2` where iRODS vault and database files will be persisted. These directories will remain in place until the user manually destroys them.

The script will run, deploy and federate two iCAT servers, and modify the three aforementioned files to be configured to use the 
newly created iRODS Docker servers. Once the script has completed, return back the the main `hydroshare` directory and run
the **hsctl** script as you normally would.

```bash
$ cd ../
$ ./hsctl rebuild --db
```

Subsequent runs may require a git checkout of the three effected files since there is no guarantee that the internal Docker IP addresses originally assigned to the containers will reused each time. 

Example:

```bash
$ git checkout hsctl hydroshare/local_settings.py scripts/templates/docker-compose-local-irods.template
```

### In Docker

If all deploys as it should you will see this reflected in the `docker ps` output. As an example:

```
$ docker ps

### Restarting after all containers have been stopped or host has been shutdown

It can be useful to retain the system state after all containers have been stopped or a system running HydroShare with local iRODS has been shutdown.

Assuming that the user has initially started with the `--persist` option, a normal initial deployment would look like this.

```bash
$ cd irods
$ ./use-local-irods.sh --persist
$ cd ../
$ ./hsctl rebuild --db
```
After some time the user could choose to stop all containers, or shut down the system they are running on.

```bash
$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```
To bring all containers back up, and to have the state of the local iRODS containers persisited, the user would do the following.

```bash
$ cd irods
$ ./use-local-irods.sh --persist
$ cd ../
$ ./hsctl start
```

This should recreate the HydroShare application as it was prior to beign stopped or shut down with all iRODS related information intact.

                                    The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) is an organization representing more than 130 U.S. universities and international water-science-related organizations and is sponsored by the National Science Foundation to provide infrastructure and services to advance the development of hydrologic science and education in the United States. The CUAHSI HydroShare is being developed as an online, collaborative environment for the sharing of hydrologic data and models. It will enable people to easily share, discover and access data and models, retrieve them to their desktop or perform analysis seamlessly in a high performance computing environment, thereby enhancing research, education and application of hydrologic knowledge.

                                    In HydroShare, we define a resource as digital content which includes the science data files or model files and their corresponding metadata information. HydroShare will include multiple resource types such as generic, time series, geographic feature class, geographic raster, multidimensional space time array data (NetCDF), model, etc. Currently, HydroShare beta system supports resource types of generic, reference time series, and raster.

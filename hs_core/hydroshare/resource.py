    Retrieve a resource identified by the pid from HydroShare. The response must contain the bytes of the indicated
    resource, and the checksum of the bytes retrieved should match the checksum recorded in the system metadata for
    that resource. The bytes of the resource will be encoded as a zipped BagIt archive; this archive will contain
    resource contents as well as science metadata. If the resource does not exist in HydroShare, then
    Exceptions.NotFound must be raised. Resources can be any unit of content within HydroShare that has been assigned a
    pid.

    All resources and resource versions will have a unique internal HydroShare identifier (pid). A DOI will be
    assigned to all formally published versions of a resource. For this method, passing in a pid (which is a HydroShare
    internal identifer) would return a specific resource version corresponding to the pid. A DOI would have to be
    resolved using HydroShare.resolveDOI() to get the pid for the resource, which could then be used with this method.
    The obsoletion chain will be contained within the system metadata for resources and so it can be traversed by
    calling HydroShare.getSystemMetadata().

    Deletes a resource managed by HydroShare. The caller must be an owner of the resource or an administrator to perform
    this function. The operation removes the resource from further interaction with HydroShare services and interfaces. The
    implementation may delete the resource bytes, and should do so since a delete operation may be in response to a problem
    with the resource (e.g., it contains malicious content, is inappropriate, or is subject to a legal request). If the
    resource does not exist, the Exceptions.NotFound exception is raised.

    pid - The unique HydroShare identifier of the resource to be deleted

    Parameters:
    pid - The unique HydroShare identifier for the resource from which the file will be deleted

    HydroShare MUST check or set the values of SystemMetadata.obsoletes and SystemMetadata.obsoletedBy so that they
    accurately represent the relationship between the new and old objects. HydroShare MUST also set
    SystemMetadata.dateSysMetadataModified. The modified system metadata entries must then be available in

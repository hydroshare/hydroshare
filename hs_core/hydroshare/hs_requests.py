This bypasses firewalls to allow Nginx to be called from within HydroShare
via its docker container address. Otherwise, Nginx cannot be reliably queried
from within a docker container because it is advertised in DNS as an address
on the other side of any firewall.

This is mainly used in end-to-end testing implemented in management commands.

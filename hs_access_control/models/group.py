# Group access data.
#
# GroupAccess has a one-to-one correspondence with the Group object
# and contains access control flags and methods specific to groups.
#
# To avoid UI difficulties, there has been an explicit decision not to modify
# the display routines for groups to display communities of groups.
# Rather, communities are exposed through a separate module community.py
# Only access-list functions have been modified for communities.
# * GroupAccess.view_resources and GroupAccess.edit_resources do reflect
#   community privileges, because they are used like access lists, while
# * GroupAccess.get_resources_with_explicit_access does *not* reflect
#   community privileges, because it is used to display a group's resources
#   on the group landing page. Including community resources would confuse this
#   depiction.

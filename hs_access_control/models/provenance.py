class GroupResourceProvenance(ProvenanceBase):
    """
    Provenance of privileges of a group over a resource.

    The group privilege over a resource is not directly meaningful.
    it is resolved instead into user privilege for each member of
    the group, as listed in UserGroupProvenance above.

    This is an append-only ledger of group privilege that serves as complete provenance
    of access changes.  At any one time, one privilege applies to each user and resource.
    This is the privilege with the latest start date.  For performance reasons, this
    information is cached in a separate table GroupResourcePrivilege.

    To undo a privilege, one appends a record to this table with PrivilegeCodes.NONE.
    This is indistinguishable from having no record at all.  Thus, this provides a
    time-based journal of what privilege was in effect when.

    An "undone" field allows one-step undo but prohibits further undo.

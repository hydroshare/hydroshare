Access control classes for hydroshare.
-------------------------

This module implements access control for hydroshare.  Privilege models act on users,
groups, and resources, and determine what objects are accessible to which users.  These models:

* determine three kinds of privilege

   1) user membership in and privilege over groups.
   2) user privilege over resources.
   3) group privilege over resources.

* track the provenance of privilege granting to:

   1) allow accounting for what happened.
   2) allow limited undo of prior actions.
   3) limit each user to accumulating one privilege over a thing...

Notes and quandaries
--------------------

* A resource or group can become unowned as a result of a user becoming inactive.
  In this case, logic must not break.
* users of ResourceAccess.edit_resources, ResourceAccess.edit_users, ResourceAccess.view_users
  should be aware that

    * Listed resources include all accessible resources (via user or group sharing)
    * privileges are cumulative over all flags
    * Thus, these are not lists for display; they are access lists.

* In general, use get_resources_with_explicit_access to create display lists.

* In general, the system reports "effective" privilege.

    * effective privilege: that after accounting for resource flags (particularly, 'published'
      and 'immutable'.
    * declared privilege: that before accounting for resource flags.

  Thus, it is possible that sharing something immutable with CHANGE privilege will result in
  effective VIEW privilege.

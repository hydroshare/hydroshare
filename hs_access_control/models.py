# TODO: invite/accept/refuse logic (including invitation classes)
# TODO: basic polymorphic routines user.can_change, user.can_view
# TODO: ensure that user and group active flags work properly in access control queries.
# TODO: there is a small chance of a race condition that could result in removal of the last resource or group owner.

# NOTES and quandaries

# 1) There is a basic problem of semantics in sharing.
#    We need to know whether to put a "share" button on the screen.
#    But this button can't share with just anyone, e.g., self.
#    However, the permissions system is somewhat blind to this.
#    Thus, we have some problems with "too much specificity" versus "too little".
# PROPOSED SOLUTION:
#    One can share with self but can only downgrade privilege.
#    Thus, the user list becomes unrestricted.

# 2) The options for unshare_*_with_* are too confusing. It tries to do
#    two different kinds of things:
#   a) completely remove a share (an owner privilege)
#   b) undo a prior share (an unprivileged action).
# PROPOSED SOLUTION:
#   a) split "undo" function out of unshare_*_with_* and into
#      undo_share_*_with_*. This eliminates the potential confusion.
#   b) unshare_* undoes the whole share; undo_share_* undoes one sharing
#      action.

        This routine is called *both* when building views and when writing responders.
        It should be called on both sides of the connection.
            * In a view builder, it determines whether buttons are shown for flag changes.
            * In a responder, it determines whether the request is valid.
        At this point, the return value is synonymous with ownership or admin.
        This may not always be true. So it is best to explicitly call this function
        rather than assuming implications between functions.

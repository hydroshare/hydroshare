tags break...this might be a deal breaker...or maybe we handle them on the backend as well
when filter by label, ONLY want to see things with that label = exclusive (only "owned" and "label")
conveniently, they also only contain items already selected. 
this means we should be able to just refresh to p=1 n=infinite and apply the label query when label is selected (but keep the active filters)
when filter by favorite, it is inclusive. "owned" or "favorite" or both
maybe we dont paginate but we do return subset from the backend (and cache it)
then paginate on the frontend (tho this wont give us any performance advantage)
fix favorites

Filter: ONLY those that ___ or ___ -> adding more filters increases number of results???
Labels: ONLY those with _label_ and (_filters_)

tie filters checkboxes to the query string
filter badge counts
set defaults for inital filters -- or cache them on client
make the pagination look nicer

--
initial page load does whatever the get parameters says, or uses default and sets them in the URL
returns HTML using the template
then as the filters change, ajax requests (to the same view) update the data using returned JSON and also update the url without page refresh
badge counts are either hidden for non active filters, or they are separate ajax requests

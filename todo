tie filters checkboxes to the query string
filter badge counts
set defaults for inital filters -- or cache them on client
test it on beta with lots of resources
make the pagination look nicer

--
initial page load does whatever the get parameters says, or uses default and sets them in the URL
returns HTML using the template
then as the filters change, ajax requests (to the same view) update the data using returned JSON and also update the url without page refresh
badge counts are either hidden for non active filters, or they are separate ajax requests

when filter by label, ONLY want to see things with that label = exclusive (only "owned" and "label")
conveniently, they also only contain items already selected. 
this means we should be able to just refresh to p=1 n=infinite and apply the label query when label is selected (but keep the active filters)
when filter by favorite, it is inclusive. "owned" or "favorite" or both

Filter: ONLY those that ___ or ___ -> adding more filters increases number of results???
Labels: ONLY those with _label_ and (_filters_)

ability to select n
get rid of extra columns in the table
fix favorites
tie filters checkboxes to the query string
esp for initial load
filter badge counts
set defaults for inital filters -- or cache them on client
add a spinner when click a filter, to indicate loading
make the pagination look nicer

--
initial page load does whatever the get parameters says, or uses default and sets them in the URL
returns HTML using the template
then as the filters change, ajax requests (to the same view) update the data using returned JSON and also update the url without page refresh
badge counts are either hidden for non active filters, or they are separate ajax requests

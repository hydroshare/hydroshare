CommonsShare is a website and hydrologic information system for sharing hydrologic data and models aimed at providing the cyberinfrastructure needed to enable innovation and collaboration in research to solve water problems. CommonsShare is designed to advance hydrologic science by enabling the scientific community to more easily and freely share products resulting from their research, not just the scientific publication summarizing a study, but also the data and models used to create the scientific publication. With CommonsShare users can: (1) share data and models with colleagues; (2) manage who has access to shared content; (3) share, access, visualize and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models; (4) use the web services API to program automated and client access; (5) publish data and models to meet the requirements of research project data management plans; (6) discover and access data and models published by others; and (7) use web apps to visualize, analyze, and run models on data in CommonsShare.

## Install

This README file is for developers interested in working on the CommonsShare code itself, or for developers or researchers learning about how the application works at a deeper level. If you simply want to _use_ the application, go to http://hydroshare.org and register an account.

If you want to install and run the source code of application locally and/or contribute to development, read on.

### [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) development environment

To quickly get started developing we offer a preconfigured development environment encapsulated within a virtual box Virtual Machine (VM). This includes the appropriate version of Ubuntu, Python, Docker, and other key dependencies and development tools.

### Simplified Installation Instructions 
1. Download the [latest OVA file here](http://distribution.hydroshare.org/public_html/)
2. Open the .OVA file with VirtualBox, this will create a guest VM
3. Follow the instructions here to share a local hydroshare folder with your guest VM
4. Start the guest VM
5. Log into the guest VM with either ssh or the GUI. The default username/password is hydro:hydro
6. From the root directory `/home/hydro`, clone this repository into the hydroshare folder
7. `cd` into the hydroshare folder and run `./hsctl rebuild --db` to build the application and run it
8. If all goes well, your local version of CommonsShare should be running at http://192.168.56.101:8000

For more detailed installation, please see this document: [Getting Started with CommonsShare](https://github.com/hydroshare/hydroshare/wiki/getting_started)

### Local MacOS Installation
1. Install brew and get the latest version of bash on your mac by running "brew install bash"
2. Install docker for MacOS.  It now includes Docker Compose in the installation so no need to download that separately.
3. Get the commonsshare code into a local directory by cloning or branching the current repository.
4. In the config subdirectory of your commonshare code installation, change the hydroshare-config.yaml file to point to your local file paths.
4. Run the hsctl script with the rebuild --db option.
5. Access the image at localhost:8000 with userid of "admin" and password of "default".

## Usage

For all intents and purposes, CommonsShare is a large Python/Django application with some extra features and technologies added on:
- SOLR for searching
- Redis for caching
- RabbitMQ for concurrency and serialization
- iRODS for a federated file system
- PostgreSQL for the database backend

#### The `hsctl` Script

The `hsctl` script is your primary tool in interacting with and running tasks against your CommonsShare install. It has the syntax `./hsccl [command]` where `[command]` is one of:

- `loaddb`: Deletes existing database and reloads the database specified in the `hydroshare-config.yaml` file.
- `managepy [args]`: Executes a `python manage.py [args]` call on the running hydroshare container.
- `maint_off`: Removes the maintenance page from view (only if NGINX is being used).
- `maint_on`: Displays the maintenance page in the browser (only if NGINX is being used).
- `rebuild`: Stops, removes and deletes only the hydroshare docker containers and images while retaining the database contents on the subsequent build as defined in the `hydroshare-config.yaml` file
- `rebuild --db`: Fully stops, removes and deletes any prior hydroshare docker containers, images and database contents prior to installing a clean copy of the hydroshare codebase as defined in the `hydroshare-config.yaml` file.
- `rebuild_index`: Rebuilds the solr/haystack index in a non-interactive way.
- `restart`: Restarts the django server only (and nginx if applicable).
- `start`: Starts all containers as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file (and nginx if applicable).
- `stop`: Stops all containers as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `update_index`: Updates the solr/haystack index in a non-interactive way.

## Testing and Debugging

### Testing

Tests are run via normal Django tools and conventions. However, you should use the `hsctl` script mentioned abouve with the `managepy` command. For example: `./hsctl managepy test hs_core.tests.api.rest.test_resmap --keepdb`.

There are currently over 600 tests in the system, so it is highly recommended that you run the test suites separately from one another.

### Debugging

You can debug via PyCharm by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/hydroshare/hydroshare/wiki/pycharm-configuration).

## Other Configuration Options

### Local iRODS

Local iRODS is _not_ required for development unless you are specifically working on the iRODS integration. However,if you want to work with iRODS or you simply want to learn about it, you can enable it locally.

### Local HTTPS

To enable HTTPS locally:
1. edit `config/hydroshare-config.template` and change the two values under `### Deployment Options ###` to `true` like so:
```
### Deployment Options ###
USE_NGINX: true
USE_SSL: true
```
2. Run `./hsctl rebuild`

Hydroshare
============

HydroShare is a collaborative website being developed for better access to data and models in the hydrologic sciences. HydroShare will provide the sustainable technology infrastructure needed to address critical issues related to water quantity, quality, accessibility, and management. HydroShare will expand the data sharing capability of the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System by broadening the classes of data accommodated, expanding capability to include the sharing of models and model components, and taking advantage of emerging social media functionality to enhance information about and collaboration around hydrologic data and models.

## Developer Notes

The HydroShare code is meant to be run by the developers in a local Linux development environment using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

For ease of standing the environment up, a predefined Xubuntu image has been created in VirtualBox and is available for download here: [hydrodev-xubuntu-06-23-2015-vbox.ova (2.2 GB)](http://distribution.hydroshare.org/public_html/hydrodev-xubuntu-06-23-2015-vbox.ova). This image is updated from time to time, but it is the developer's responsibility to keep the VM in good running order once they've installed it locally.

The **hydrodev** VM is distributed as a VirtualBox Appliance and can be installed by choosing `File > Import Appliance` from the VirtualBox menu.

A predefined user named `hydro` with sudo rights has been designated as the default user.

- User: **hydro**
- Password: **hydro**

## Running HydroShare

The hydroshare code is configured with the assumption the the developer is using the **hydrodev** VM and will be operating as user **hydro** from the `/home/hydro` directory.

A new installation would first require the cloning of the hydroshare repository.

```bash
hydro@hydro-VirtualBox:~$ cd /home/hydro/
hydro@hydro-VirtualBox:~$ git clone https://github.com/hydroshare/hydroshare.git
Cloning into 'hydroshare'...
remote: Counting objects: 15029, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (169/169), done.
remote: Total 15029 (delta 76), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 14856
Receiving objects: 100% (15029/15029), 50.64 MiB | 27.23 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (10077/10077), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
hydro@hydro-VirtualBox:~$ cd hydroshare/
```
The developer should base any work they do from the develop branch as follows.

```bash
hydro@hydro-VirtualBox:~/hydroshare$ git checkout develop
Branch develop set up to track remote branch develop from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'develop'
hydro@hydro-VirtualBox:~/hydroshare$ git checkout -b my-development-branch
Switched to a new branch 'my-development-branch'
```
At this point the developer could deploy the base hydroshare code in hydrodev using the `hsctl` script.

```bash
hydro@hydro-VirtualBox:~/hydroshare$ ./hsctl deploy
...
Operations to perform:
  Synchronize unmigrated apps: debug_toolbar, galleries, irods_browser_app, accounts, conf, rest_framework, forms, gis, generic, boot, comments, blog, jquery_ui, crispy_forms, core, hs_metrics, filebrowser_safe, sitemaps, pages, mobile, autocomplete_light, djcelery, widget_tweaks, django_extensions
  Apply all migrations: redirects, ref_ts, sessions, admin, hs_swat_modelinstance, hs_model_program, sites, auth, hs_geo_raster_resource, theme, contenttypes, hs_tools_resource, ga_resources, hs_app_netCDF, hs_core, django_docker_processes, ga_ows, django_irods, hs_modelinstance, hs_app_timeseries
Synchronizing apps without migrations:
  Creating tables...
  Installing custom SQL...
  Installing indexes...
Running migrations:
  No migrations to apply.
```

When the build is finished the developer would be able to access the running hydroshare site at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

A single administrative user is included with the deployment.

- username: **admin**
- password: **default**

### hsctl

The supplied HydroShare Control script named `hsctl` has been created to provide the most common deployment methods that a developer would use.

```bash
hydro@hydro-VirtualBox:~/hydroshare$ ./hsctl --help
*** HydroShare Control script ***
usage: ./hsctl deploy      # deletes all database and container contents and deploys from scratch
usage: ./hsctl loaddb      # loads database specified in hydroshare-config.yaml into running container
usage: ./hsctl rebuild     # deletes hydroshare container contents only and deploys using exsiting database
usage: ./hsctl restart     # restarts the hydroshare container without rebuilding
usage: ./hsctl start       # attempts to start all containers
usage: ./hsctl stop        # stops all running containers
```

Functionality

- **deploy:** Fully stops, removes and deletes any prior hydroshare docker containers, images and database contents prior to installing a clean copy of the hydroshare codebase as defined in the `hydroshare-config.yaml` file
- **loaddb:** Deletes existing database and reloads the database specified in the `hydroshare-config.yaml` file.
- **rebuild:** Stops, removes and deletes only the hydroshare docker containers and images while retaining the database contents on the subsequent build as defined in the `hydroshare-config.yaml` file
- **restart:** Restarts the django server only (and nginx if applicable).
- **start:** Starts all containers as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file (and nginx if applicable).
- **stop:** Stops all containers as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### hydroshare-config.yaml

Located at `config/hydroshare-config.yaml` this file defines the local development environment and how the application should be run.

```yaml

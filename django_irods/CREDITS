From Jefferson Heard:

Thanks go out to the #django channel and the django-users mailing list for all their
consultative help.  This code is the result of my necessities for the successful
completion of several ongoing projects with the NSF and others, including CI-BER
and the National Weather Service's WxEM collaborative agreement with RENCI.

Thanks to all of you,

Jeff.
